# Introduction
A game for my final year project.

Initially, I had no knowledge regarding C# language. Even I am a Computer Engineering student, my course did not offer any particular coding languages such as Python, C++ or C# which is largely used to work with games.

Unity is very great platform to start with, it supports broad features and privileges for free-source developers who are not able to feed themselves. Unity provide easy and user-friendly user-interface (UI) for developer to control and manage their project. 

Despite its usage for the game mechanism, Unity is useful, even as a pictue/image/model cropping. All the sprites and resources are cropped using Unity itself.

Unity has numerous features within the program itself which reduce the time for developers to find another tools to edit the pictures.

# Main Language
C# (abbreviated as C-Sharp)


# Purpose of Project
Mainly to train slow-minded children in order to enhance their potential in precision, decision-making, and time-predicting. The purpose is to serve the needs of the children by combining both entertainment and mindful puzzle. 


# Duration
Five (5) months. (June 2017 - October 2017)


# Project Timeline
  - 26th April 2017
    - Getting started with reading articles and watching videos regarding game development. <br>
  - End of April 2017
    - Suppressing the options for to ease both language and IDE choosing
  - 5th May 2017
    - Digging for copyright-free materials and models as the development is for open-source which no benefits will be in returned.
  - 15th May 2017
    - Picking advices and recommendation from game developers. 
      - What is best language to build a game?
      - How to design a level?
      - Which will be the best IDE?
      - If location and time matters then where and when should the project ends?
      
  - 25th May 2017

    - Project is delayed for some personal reasons. (school, family, etc) 
  - 15 June 2017
    - Project resumed.
    - Start by training a few of simple codes. 
  - 16 June 2017 until the end of project
    - As most of the project accomplishment went undocumented. Thus, a summary is made here to tick the project as finished.
    - Most of the time, errors and problems are encountered on numerous occassion such as leveling, saving game session, etc.

# Future Plans
Even the project went well, the main expectation is partially not fulfilled. The missing part from the main plan; 
- Creating a life system, which will be reduced or added based on certain circumstances.
- More miscellaneous features such as resizing player, complex enemies mechanism, etc.
- The project went with so much speed, resulting into the ugly map design and coordination.
- Adding more player characters, even with special abilities according to the accomplishment of the player.
- TBD.
